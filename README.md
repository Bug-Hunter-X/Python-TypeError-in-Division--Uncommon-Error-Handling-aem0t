# Python TypeError in Division: Uncommon Error Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python: a `TypeError` that occurs during division when an integer is divided by a string or other incompatible data type.

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.py` offers improved handling for this issue.

The error handling in `bug.py` catches the `TypeError`, but a more robust solution might involve type checking before performing the division.

This example illustrates the importance of thorough error handling and data validation in Python applications.
